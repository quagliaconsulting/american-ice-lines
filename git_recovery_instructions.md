## Recovery Options

### Option 1: Cherry-pick the Lost Commit (Recommended)
```bash
# This will apply your lost commit on top of the current branch
git cherry-pick b80e06b
```

### Option 2: Reset to the Lost Commit
```bash
# WARNING: This will discard the current state and go back to your commit
# Only use if you don't want to keep the rebased changes
git reset --hard b80e06b
```

### Option 3: Apply the Saved Patch
```bash
# I've saved your changes to a patch file
git apply lost_changes.patch
```

### Option 4: Merge Both Versions
```bash
# If you want to keep both your changes and the rebased changes
git checkout -b recovery-branch b80e06b
git merge main
# Resolve any conflicts
git checkout main
git merge recovery-branch
```

## What Happened?
When you ran `git pull --rebase`, Git:
1. Temporarily removed your local commit (b80e06b)
2. Applied the remote changes
3. Tried to replay your commit on top, but it seems it was replaced with a different version

The good news is your commit is still in the reflog and can be recovered!

## Recommended Action
Use **Option 1** (cherry-pick) as it's the safest way to recover your changes while keeping the rebased history intact.

## Verification After Recovery
After applying any recovery option, verify:
1. Check that all your images are in place: `ls ice-website/public/images/`
2. Review the modified files to ensure your changes are restored
3. Test the website locally: `cd ice-website && npm run dev`
